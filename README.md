# NAME

action-clock - A clock using Github Actions.

[![Clock Status](https://github.com/jmahler/action-clock/workflows/Clock/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jmahler/action-clock/actions?query=workflow%3AClock)

# DESCRIPTION

Each time this action is run, it writes the current time
to TIME.out, and commits the change, to this repo itself.
Interestingly, the actual time between runs varies dramatically.
